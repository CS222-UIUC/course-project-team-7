Summary: Band Buddies serves as a user-friendly way to connect with the local music community in your area. Users can interact with local bands, learn about their music, and support them. Bands can also log in to the Band Buddies application to interact with users and fans. The motivation for Band Buddies came from our team’s mutual appreciation for music and our desire to learn more about and support the local music scene in Champaign-Urbana area. 
Technical Architecture: The Tech Stack for the Band Buddies application consists of: Bootstrap 4, React, create-react-app, Reactstrap, and Popper.js. Our team used an example React template as a skeleton to guide the flow of the project. Additionally, all team members worked in conjunction with the tech stack to complete the Band Buddies application.
